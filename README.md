# bookhive

A new Flutter project.

This is a mobile application which upon entering a quote, returns the relevant book title for which it uses the openlibrary API.
The work is still in progress and any kind of suggestion is welcomed.

The work has been put on hold for quite some time, I will get back to it and improve it soon. I am aware of the shortcomings of this app
